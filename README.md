Clojurescript homebrew formula
==============================

This is the [Clojurescript quick start guide](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start) converted to a homebrew formula.

Note: The following instructions are useful if you need to use the ClojureScript compiler directly. For a more integrated workflow, [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) with [lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild) is recommended.

Installation instructions:

```bash
brew tap danielsz/clojurescript
brew install clojurescript
```

Enjoy!
